经过八个多小时的飞机延误后，晚上九点我和呱终于呼吸到了第一口波多黎各温暖湿润带着青苔味的海风，一扫纽约冬天的寒冷干燥。取上车我开始给San Juan的各大“网红餐厅”打电话，由于是平安夜，要不是无人接听，要不就是马上打烊。我们像无头苍蝇瞎转悠到一条居民区附近，突然被转角一阵勾魂的饭菜香味所吸引。厨师是意大利人，说现在这个点只能外带不能堂食，风尘仆仆饥肠辘辘的我们赶紧满心欢喜地点上了三文鱼和猪肉意面，再行车一小时到达预定的民宿后开始大快朵颐，那盒油油的意面现在想来还能勾起肚子里不少的小馋虫。

Education must also train one for quick, **resolute and effective thinking**. To think incisively and to think for one's self is very difficult. 

> We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. 


The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals.

The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated?

We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character--that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living.
